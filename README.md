# MyProjects
Academic projects completed throughout my undergraduate program at the University of Maryland - College Park. Consists of hands-on projects exploring and visualizing data through Python.

# Data Science/Analysis Projects:

## NYPD Misconduct Data Analysis
This was my final project for my Data Science course this spring semester. My team focused on using the CCRB misconduct dataset to analyze misconduct reports within the NYPD. Combining this data with historic arrest numbers, and other information scraped from the web it tells a powerful story about the NYPD.

## API Data Analysis
Project that utilizes the Stack Exchange API to scrape from six different subcommunities to analyze which data science tool is more popular (R or Pandas).

## Regular Expression Data Analysis
Exemplifies my knowledge of regular expressions to pull data out of raw email files, as well as server logs to create dataframes for analysis.

## Instacart Data Analysis
Project that focuses on analyzing the different items that purchased at different hours of the day using Instacart. Utilizing the pandas package in python to merge dataframes and create visuals in Matplotlib.

## Open Source Data Analysis User Guide:
This is the user guide from my final capstone project. The idea behind this project was to identify an open source data tool and document how to use the different features within your tool. My group chose to analyze USAFacts.org, specifically the Government Finances section and detailed how to use this open source tool. The goal of this project is to make it easier for future UMD iSchool and journalism students conduct research using open source data tools.


# Design Projects:

## University of Maryland Athletics Live-Streaming Platform Prototype:
This is a link to see my prototype for my user-design project: https://marvelapp.com/prototype/48h61jh. The goal was to create a prototype for a live-streaming platform for UMD athletics. If you would like to see the different steps we took throughout the research and design process you can visit: https://mostuniqueteam.weebly.com/. 

## Healthify Application Prototype:
This is the link to see my prototype for my patient-centered technology project: https://marvelapp.com/prototype/298f428g/screen/78808804. The idea behind this prototype came to me when one of my friend's came down with a heart condition. The idea behind my prototype is to simplify the process when ordering out at restaurants. The apps goal is for users' to create an account that will allow them to input any of their known health conditions, allergies, or diet restrictions. The features of this app include: a map to see restaurants tailored towards your condition, a community page and resources to learn more about your condition, and a QR code scanning option to filter a menu when you are out at a restaurant. This helps users not have to disclose their conditions when out to eat, and limits the risk of potential allergic reactions at restaurants. NOTE: this is just a prototype and a lot of these features aren't fully developed.
